# IMDB-prediction
## Overview
This is a small project of practicing NLP with transformer architecture. Using IMDB dataset, the model is trained to predict whether a comment is positive or negative.

## Dataset
IMDB dataset has 50K movie reviews.
> This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

The csv file looks like:
| review | sentiment | 
|-------|:-----:|
| This show pulls no punches...   | positive  |
| because two people are kille...  |  negative  | 
| ... | ... |
| Robert Colomb has two full-time... |  negative  |
